This report focuses on a subset of completed clinical trials centered on lung cancer, sourced from
clinicaltrials.gov. The dataset offers extensive insights into various dimensions of these trials,
encompassing locations, sponsors, participant demographics, conditions studied, and
interventions employed. The primary objectives include performing exploratory data analysis
(EDA) and structuring the dataset for efficient searchability across critical dimensions.
Data Overview
The dataset comprises 30 columns and 1652 rows, representing distinct clinical trials related to
lung cancer research. Addressing missing values ensured data uniformity, with 'Age' columns
imputed using the most frequent value to maintain demographic distribution. Key attributes span
unique identifiers (NCT Number), study details, trial statuses, conditions, interventions,
outcomes, sponsors, demographics, phases, dates, locations, and associated documents,
providing a comprehensive foundation for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings
a) Location (Country, State)
Top 7 locations based on trials include Houston, India, California, Oregon, London, Ashland,
and Mexico.
b) Sponsor
Top sponsors identified: National Cancer Institute, Eli Lilly and Company, Hoffman La Roche,
Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, revealing significant contributors to lung cancer trials.
c) Collaborator
Key collaborators include the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Merck Sharp Dohme LLC, Bristol
Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca, underscoring collaborative efforts in research.

d) Cancer Type
Dominant cancer types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (425), Lung Cancer (192), Carcinoma, and
Small Cell Lung Cancer (35).
e) Participant Age
Most participants fall within the 'ADULT' and 'OLDER_ADULT' categories, with some trials
involving children alongside adults or older adults.
f) Specific Conditions (Genetic Mutations and Biomarkers)
Prevalent conditions encompass Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lung Cancer, Carcinoma, Breast
Cancer, and Small Cell Lung Cancer, offering insights into the studied conditions' frequencies.
g) Most Used Cancer Treatments and Medical Interventions
A diverse array of interventions was identified. 'Radiation', 'Carboplatin', and 'Biological'
emerged as the most frequently used treatments, showcasing varying utilization levels (ranging
from 333 to 31) in lung cancer clinical trials.
Conclusion
The analysis of this dataset highlights notable trends and patterns in lung cancer clinical trials,
emphasizing the diversity of approaches in treatments, prominent sponsors, collaborative efforts,
prevalent cancer types, and participant demographics. These findings provide valuable insights
into the landscape of lung cancer research and trials.
